           <p>My name is Dan and in 2018 i made a career switch and
            started working as an IT/service manager. This strengthened my skills and my love for IT. After that i build
            and maintained our companies website. Now i am sold and looking to become a front-end developer. I hope that with the studies of Winc Acadamy i am able to achieve this goal.
